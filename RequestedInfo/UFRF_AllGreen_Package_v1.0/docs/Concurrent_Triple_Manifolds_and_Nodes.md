# Concurrent Triple Manifolds, Nodes, and Nodes‑of‑Nodes (UFRF → YM fiber view)

UFRF’s **concurrent trinity** (−½, 0, +½) gives rise to an SU(2)ₑ×SU(2)ₐ structure (axial E vs planar B/B′)
and a **26 half‑step** lattice (double cover). In the gauge‑bundle language, treat these as *concurrent sections* over
spacetime with node‑of‑nodes structure (interference of interference): this mirrors YM fiber bundles with local frames
and transition functions. The **REST** gate (position 10/13) is the natural “soldering” locus where couplings exchange
most efficiently (√φ window), while early half‑gates (0.5,1.5) act as gauge anchors. These ideas support treating SU(3)
as an optional **container** embedding that does not modify the U(1) Maxwell proof but provides a natural host for
non‑Abelian structure. fileciteturn0file12 fileciteturn0file6 fileciteturn0file11
