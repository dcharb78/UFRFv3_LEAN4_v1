# UFRF.AngularEmbedding

**Keystone 2: The Angular Embedding**

When the Trinity `{-½, 0, +½}` is constrained to a closed loop (S¹),
the conservation and mediation constraints force:

1. The poles `±½` map to antipodal points (separated by π)
2. The observer `0` must sit at **both** orthogonal positions (0° and 180°)
3. The Rod (polarity axis) and Staff (observer axis) cross at exactly 90°

This promotes discrete conservation into continuous rotational symmetry,
planting the seed for Noether's theorem.

## Status
- Structure definition: ✅ compiles
- `observer_is_orthogonal`: 🏗️ needs Real.Angle arithmetic from Mathlib
- `rod_staff_orthogonal`: 🏗️ follows from observer position

An angular embedding of the Trinity onto the unit circle.

We represent angles as real numbers (in radians) modulo 2π.
The constraints force the geometry without free parameters.

**Theorem 5a: Observer is Orthogonal to Poles**

Given antipodal poles at angles θ and θ+π, the equidistant condition
forces the observer to angle θ + π/2 or θ - π/2.

Proof sketch: If `|x - θ| = |x - (θ + π)|` on the real line,
then `x = θ + π/2` (the midpoint of the shorter arc).

**Theorem 5c: Rod-Staff Orthogonality**

The polarity axis (Rod: connecting ±½) and the observer axis (Staff: connecting
the two observer positions at 0° and 180°) intersect at exactly 90°.

This follows directly from the observer being at ±π/2 from the poles.

**Three-Manifold Quotient**

The circle is divided into 4 arcs by the Rod-Staff cross.
But because the Observer at 0° and 180° are the *same entity*,
the topological quotient reduces 4 arcs to exactly 3 manifolds.

This corresponds to the 3 LOG grades and seeds SU(3) color symmetry.
