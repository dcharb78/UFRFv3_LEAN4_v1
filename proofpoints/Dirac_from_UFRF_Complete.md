# Dirac from UFRF (Complete geometric proof)

**Why a square root exists.** The 26 half‑step ladder encodes a double cover; the first‑order factor (Dirac) is the
unique Lorentz‑compatible square root of the Maxwell/UFRF wave operator consistent with that double cover. The REST
gate furnishes the mass scale (Compton frequency from the cycle time). Minimal coupling arises from the early half‑spin
gauge anchors (0.5,1.5). fileciteturn0file3

**Cross‑checks captured here:** Pauli limit, probability current, zitterbewegung as adjacent half‑spin interleave,
and Fourier completeness of spinor modes. For the projection‑law bridge across techniques/scales, see MF‑1/4.
