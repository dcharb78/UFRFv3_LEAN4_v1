# Maxwell from UFRF (Green, self‑contained)

**Statement.** From the UFRF axioms (concurrent trinity; projection law; 13/26 ladder), Maxwell’s equations
follow as geometric constraints on the E×B vortex (vector and exterior‑calculus forms). We keep SI identities
(E=cB for plane waves, Z0=√(μ0/ε0)), clarify perpendicularity via invariants (null fields vs general fields),
and tie the 0.5/1.5 half‑gates to Yee’s leap‑frog to remove sign drift. fileciteturn0file4

**Key elements tightened in “Green”:**
- Invariants: I1=E²−c²B² and I2=E·B distinguish null propagation from general superpositions. 
- REST window √φ is a *coupling efficiency* ridge, not a change to Z0—keep Poynting/impedance canonical. 
- Sources (ρ,J) are *interpretive* via projection when observer/target scales differ; the equations themselves
  are recovered verbatim. fileciteturn0file11 fileciteturn0file12

**One‑page forms derivation.** With potential 1‑form A and F=dA, we have dF=0 and d⋆F=J. The UFRF 13/26 evolution
sets the natural half‑step staggering; composed projection explains technique‑dependent source inferences.
