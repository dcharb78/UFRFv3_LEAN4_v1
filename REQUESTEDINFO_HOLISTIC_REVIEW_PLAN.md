# RequestedInfo Holistic Review Plan (Status Pointer)

This file is intentionally minimal to keep the root pipeline tight.

## Status
- The detailed historical plan has been archived:
  - `_archive/2026-02-11_plan_cleanup/REQUESTEDINFO_HOLISTIC_REVIEW_PLAN_full_2026-02-11.md`
- Active execution lives in:
  - `PROOF_CONTINUATION_PLAN.md`
  - `LEAN_PROOFS_THEORY_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md`
- Active claim extraction/routing state lives in:
  - `RequestedInfo/review_state/REVIEW_BACKLOG.csv`
  - `RequestedInfo/review_state/CLAIM_ATOMS.csv`
  - `RequestedInfo/review_state/CANONICAL_CLAIMS.csv`
  - `RequestedInfo/review_state/CLAIM_ROUTING.csv`

## Rule
Do not add new execution steps here; update the two active plan files above.
